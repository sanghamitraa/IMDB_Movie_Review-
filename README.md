# Project Name  IMDB Movie Review
> Outline a brief description of your project.

    IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify reviews as 'positive' or 'negative'. The data is divied into training and test sets. The training set contains 800 positive and 800 negative movie reviews whereas the test set contains 200 positive and 200 negative movie reviews. It has two categories: Pos (reviews that express a positive or favourable sentiment) and Neg (reviews that express a negative or unfavourable sentiment). For this exercise, we will assume that all reviews are either positive or negative; there are no neutral reviews.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
    IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify reviews as 'positive' or 'negative'.
- What is the background of your project?
    Positive reviews (reviews that express a positive or favourable sentiment) and Negative reviews (reviews that express a negative or unfavourable sentiment) are used to give feedback for the movies.
- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve? 
    To build a Multinomial Naive Bayes classification model to classify the Reviews.
- What is the dataset that is being used?

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis 
    By using Bernoulli Naive Bayes model the accuracy is 79%, sensitivity is nearly 70% and Specificity is 89%
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis  
    By using Multinomial Naive Bayes model the accuracy is nearly 83%, sensitivity is nearly 80% and Specificity is 86%
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
    The AUC is 87%
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
    Higher the area under the curve of an ROC curve, the better is your model.
